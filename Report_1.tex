    This report basically covers nothing.

    \section{Background}
    Although I thought it would be boring to write this report at first, I found it quite interesting while writing it. It turned out that talking was indeed much cheaper than coding.
    \section{Main Contents}
    I began to download Linux the minute I knew about \emph{Steam} on Linux. However, the installation of Python was hours later than that, for I had been playing \emph{Civilization} on Linux before. \\
    I already had a github account before, so I didn't bother register another one. Writing Readme.md turned out to be a lot of fun.\\
    By the way, you guys should try telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl in Bash.\\
    Well, I guess this is pretty much it.\\ 
    \section{Conclusion}
    Linux is a lot of fun.
    \section{Acknowledgement}
    Thanks to Prof.Cai for choosing Python in this course. I am really looking forward to following courses.

    \section{Main Contents}
    I have been using Word(unauthorized) as my text editor ever since I began to use computers. Using vim has truly opened a new world for me. I love its light, elegant texting style. I will try to improve my vim texting skills.\\
    By the way, I decided not to start the sacred war between emacs and vim.\\ 
    \section{Conclusion}
    Vim is a lot of fun.

    Thanks to Prof.Cai for choosing vim in this course. I am really looking forward to following courses.

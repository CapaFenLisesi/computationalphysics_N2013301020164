# My Official Computational Physics Repository
#####Produced by James Lee :octocat:

##About this repository
This repository is built for the course **Computational Physics** lectured by **Prof.Cai**.
Programs concerning this course will be uploaded to this repository.

Citing of my code will be allowed if my contribution is acknowledged.

Discussion about coding is most welcome. 

Contact me at *jameslee@whu.edu.cn*.

##BlahBlah...
**Richard Feynman** once said:
>It's great for a physicist to have a computer.

Maybe he didn't say the exact words, but I believe he could have said these *words*.
Nowadays, Internet is becoming cruical to physical study.
If you don't buy my words, maybe you should check out this site [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/).

Or some of the following sites:

-[CERN](http://home.cern/)

-[Nature](http://www.nature.com/index.html)

-[Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/)

-[Porn](http://journals.aps.org/about)

I'm **excited** :frog: for this course. I'm ready to **do a little work** :frog: in this area.
Here are the tasks I prepare to accomplish in this semester:

1. Have fun

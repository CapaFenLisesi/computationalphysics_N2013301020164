##About this repository
This repository is built for the course **Computational Physics** lectured by **Prof.Cai**.
Programs concerning this course will be uploaded to this repository.

Citing of my code will be allowed if my contribution is acknowledged.

Discussion about coding is most welcome.

##BlahBlah...
**Richard Feynman** once said:
>It's great for a physicist to have a computer.

Maybe he didn't say the exact words, but I believe he could have said these *words*.
Nowadays, Internet is becoming cruical to physical study.
If you don't buy my words, maybe you should check out this site [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/).

Or some of the following sites:

-[CERN](http://home.cern/)

-[Nature](http://www.nature.com/index.html)

-[Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/)

-[Porn](http://journals.aps.org/about)

I'm **excited** :frog: for this course. I'm ready to **do a little work** :frog: in this area.
Here are the tasks I prepare to accomplish in this semester:

1. Have fun
  1. have fun
  2. have fun
2. HAVE FUN
